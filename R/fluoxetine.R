#' @title Fluoxetine data set
#'
#' @description Twenty rats were given fluoxetine and tested in the
#' forced swim test (FST).
#'
#' @details Twenty rats were randomly assigned to a control condition
#' or three doses of fluoxetine. Fluoxetine was administered in the
#' drinking water. The amount of time the rats were immobile in the
#' FST was measured and greater immobility time implies a more
#' depressive phenotype.
#'
#' @format A data frame with 20 rows and 2 variables:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{dose:}{Dose of fluoxetine (0, 80, 160, or 240 mg/L).}
#'   \item{time.immob:}{Total immobility time in the FST (seconds).} }
