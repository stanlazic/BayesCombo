\title{Calculate a 'Bayesian Safety' (BS) factor}
\usage{
BSfactor(x, n = 100, sig = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{PMPlist}.}

\item{n}{Number of steps between 0.33333 and 0.99999 to calculate the BS
factor. Increasing n gives a more accurate estimate.}

\item{sig}{The 'significance' cut-off value for a non-null posterior
model probability.}
}
\value{
Object of class 'BSfactor' which contains a matrix of final posterior
model probabilities, a matrix of prior model probabilities, the 'boundary'
and which hypothesis is being considered.
}
\description{
Calculates the prior probability for the null that gives a just
significant result.
}
\details{
When the posterior probability for a non-null hypothesis is large,
it may be of interest to calculate the prior for the null that gives a just
significant result. Here 'significant' is a threshold that the posterior must
exceed. For example, if a series of experiments on homeopathy gives a
posterior probability of 0.98 in favour homeopathy's effectiveness, we can
calculate the strength of the prior needed to make the posterior just pass
the 0.98 threshold. If the BS factor is very large (sceptical prior), then we
may be more inclined to believe the results because they were sufficient to
shift a strong prior belief in no effect. If the data can only overcome a
weak prior, then the results may be unconvincing, despite having a large
posterior probability. We can ask ourselves if our prior is greater or less
than the BS factor, and judge the results accordingly.
