\title{Updating Posterior Model Proababilities}
\usage{
\method{update}{PMP}(BFcombo)
}
\arguments{
\item{BFcombo}{An object of class BFcombo}
}
\value{
Object of class BFcombo which contains a matrix of posterior model probabilities for each updated step.
}
\description{
The posterior model probabilities can be calculated using the unconstrained Bayes factors and then updated.
}
\details{
The posterior model probabilities are then set as the prior model porbablities. This is an updating step and will allow the combination of several studies.
Once the prior model probabilities are updated, the posterior model probabilitiesare calcuated again.

\examples{
x <- prior.var( beta1 = c(0.090,0.140,1.090,1.781),
     var1 = c(0.000841,0.002916,0.008649,0.032041),
     beta0 = 0, pi0 = rep(1/3,3))
x <- u.post.param(x)
x <- unconstrained.BF(x,1000)
x <- update.PMP(x)
